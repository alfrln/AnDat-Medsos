144,CHARTOU Woman's Casual Loose Fit Stretched Waist Knee Length Wide Leg Culottes Shorts,4,Looks good for the most part. It's made out of some fabric that dries fast which is great for the summer. Downside is that the inseam for one of the legs is about half an inch longer than the other and it had a bunch of strings hanging off that I had to trim.,https://a.co/d/a3cIoaX
145,CHARTOU Woman's Casual Loose Fit Stretched Waist Knee Length Wide Leg Culottes Shorts,4,"The material is very thin which takes away from the point of getting these for modesty.

158,Amazon Essentials Women's Supersoft Terry Relaxed-Fit Culotte Pant (Previously Daily Ritual),2,The pants fit nicely and the material is soft but they stink! I've washed them several times hoping to get rid of the smell but have not succeeded.

159,Amazon Essentials Women's Supersoft Terry Relaxed-Fit Culotte Pant (Previously Daily Ritual),2,"Loved these straight out of the bag. I wore them on a 6 hr. road trip and they were so comfortable!

163,Amazon Essentials Women's Supersoft Terry Relaxed-Fit Culotte Pant (Previously Daily Ritual),3,"I bought the black and navy pair. The navy ones are super cute with like a messy stripy design.

170,Amazon Essentials Women's Supersoft Terry Relaxed-Fit Culotte Pant (Previously Daily Ritual),4,"This was a lovely surprise! It fits well and is flattering.
